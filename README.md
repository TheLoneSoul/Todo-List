# Simple To-Do List

A lightweight To-Do List web application built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This app allows users to manage tasks efficiently with CRUD operations, all stored in the browser's localStorage.

- Click a task to mark it as **completed** with a line-through style.
- Use the checkbox to **delete tasks**.
